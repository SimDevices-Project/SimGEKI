            # Welcome to the SimGEKI Nightly Builds!

            ## What is this?

            Nightly Builds are the latest development versions of the SimGEKI firmware, automatically built with every commit to the main branch. This means you always have access to the most recent changes and features, but please note that these builds are not guaranteed to be stable.

            ## How to use?

            Download the firmware files from the assets below and flash them to your SimGEKI device. Make sure to check the compatibility with your hardware version. To flash the firmware, you can refer to the following link for instructions [Update Firmware](https://sim.bysb.net/#/simgeki2/configs/update-firmware/)

            ## Build Information
